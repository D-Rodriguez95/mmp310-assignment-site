    <h1>Homework Assignment One<br/></h1>
    <p class="author">Website: http://deprogrammed.org/ <br/></p>
    <p class="intro"> I really enjoy gaming and when I came across this site its the same exact feel I received. It granted me the ultimate immersive feel and although it does provide its own factual information on Deprogrammed imagine if anything else. It was a very calming experience yet alarming because at first I had no clue what was to happen and it kept me driven. The feeling of being able to control the person they give you as they feed you their goal, their purpose was right on point.  <br/></p>
    <br/>
     <p class="intro"> The site began as dark and presented itself as a normal site to begin with. The site gave you it's introduction and set you up for what's to come. The simplicity of allowing the user to simply move was enough to entice me because I knew this wasn't a game this was a website. All entities are presented such as finding other links to various objects offered by the site so you necessarily have to go through the immersion.   <br/></p>
